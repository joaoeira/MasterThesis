abstract = {There is strong evidence that people exploit their bargaining power in competitivemarkets but not in bilateral bargaining situations.There is also strong evidence that people exploit free-riding opportunities in voluntary cooperation games. Yet, when they are given the opportunity to punish free riders, stable cooperation is maintained, although punishment is costly for those who punish. This paper asks whether there is a simple common principle that can explain this puzzling evidence.We show that if some people care about equity the puzzles can be resolved. It turns out that the economic environment determines whether the fair types or the selÂŽsh types dominate equilibriumbehavior.},

abstract = {Binmore and Shaked (this issue) criticize Fehr and Schmidt's (1999) model of inequality aversion. We present a considerable body of experimental research supporting the inequality aversion motive. Binmore and Shaked also urge experimentalists to adopt "a more skeptical attitude when far-reaching claims about human behavior are extrapolated from very slender data." It is true that experimental findings indicate that the standard neoclassical model fails to predict a considerable range of strategic behaviors widely observed in the laboratory, particularly under conditions where normative behavior is prevalent in every-day social life. This is indeed a "far-reaching claim," but one amply justified by an impressive and constantly growing body of evidence from experiments. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
